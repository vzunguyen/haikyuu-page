          There are plenty of guys in this world who we are no match to, and
          it's natural to find people like that are amazing. I think being able
          to dive headfirst into things is a talent in and of itself, and it
          doesn't matter what you call them. It's not like genius is an insult.
          But if you're thinking they're geniuses from the very start, that just
          mean you've just lost before you've even started a match with them and
          it's rude.

          "Talent is something you make bloom, Instinct is something you
          polish."
          <br />
          <br />
          Oikawa Tooru, one of the best setters throughout Haikyuu!! series, has
          always been scared of those so-called 'geniuses'. His mindset was that
          no matter how hard he tries, he will always lose to the "more
          talented" ones. Even when he put in the same effort, praticing as
          hard, he will always lose, or so he believed. He wanted to go to
          nationals, he wanted to be on top but he couldn't just by a mere
          thought "I am not talented enough, I am not a genius".
          <br />
          <br />
          However, in the second match against Karasuno, Oikawa remembered the
          words of a former coach: "You don't know how far you'll go if you
          don't try. There's nothing you can do about the growth of other more
          talented people so instead, focus on yourself and what you can do.".
          <br />
          <br />
          Oikawa then said during the match "Today maybe the day you seize the
          opportunity to make your talent bloom, or maybe tomorrow, the day
          after that, or even next year, or maybe even after you turn 30. The
          time you choose to make it happen is up to you, but if you think you
          don't have it then you won't have it for your entire life.". Instead
          of accepting his fate "Maybe one day you will surpass me, but today is
          not the day", Oikawa in this second match believed in himself that one
          day his talent will bloom.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the last set to Iwaizumi, he said the line and allowed his talent
          to bloom with a crazy cross court tempo set. He let go of all the
          doubts he had about his abilities and just did whatever he had been
          praticing for year. That was when his talent bloomed.
